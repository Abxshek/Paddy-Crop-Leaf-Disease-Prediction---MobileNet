# Paddy Crop Leaf Disease Prediction using MobileNet

## üîç Project Overview

This project uses **MobileNet**, a lightweight and efficient deep learning architecture, to classify paddy crop leaves into various disease categories. The model helps farmers and agricultural experts identify diseases early and take preventive measures.

## üß† Model

I used the **MobileNet architecture**, pretrained on ImageNet, and fine-tuned it on a custom paddy crop disease dataset consisting of 10 categories (9 diseases + 1 healthy leaf).

## üìÇ Dataset

- The dataset contains 10 folders, each representing a class:
  - Bacterial Leaf Blight
  - Bacterial Leaf Streak
  - Bacterial Panicle Leaf 
  - Brown Spot
  - Leaf Blast
  - Dead Heart
  - Downy Mildew
  - Hispa
  - Tungro
  - (add Normal Healthy Leaf)
- All images are resized to `224x224` for preprocessing.

## ‚úÖ Achievements

- **Accuracy:** 96%
- **Model Size:** Lightweight and optimized for mobile/IoT devices
- **Platform:** Trained using TensorFlow/Keras
